# User Experience Design

## App Map

For our project, there are a few pages that are important. Users can start from the home page, then jump to login page, a detailed post page, their profile, or create new post. Also, users access the "create an account" page from login page. Besides, users are able to access a detailed post from their profile too.

Users can create new post with link of a spotify playlist. They can also write a Caption and give the post a name.

### Hamburger Icon

We create a hamburger icon for every page. Therefore, the user can direct to home, profile, or create new post. Also, they can sign out with the hamburger icon.
Here is an example when the user open the hamburger icon: ![hamburger home](ux-design/Wireframe/Home(Feed)_Hamburger.png)
